            "balancing_alignment": "What is the difference between balancing and alignment?",
            "balancing_alignment_text": "• Balancing: Ensures the wheel rolls smoothly without vibration at speed (done with every tire change).\n• Alignment: Ensures wheels are straight relative to the car for driving straight and even tire wear (needed if pulling to one side or after suspension repair).",
